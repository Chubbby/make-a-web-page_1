        <p>
         The web contains: the web, HTML, URLs, HTTP, and Web apps. Major pieces are your computer + browser (IE, Firefox), internet cloud, and servers. The internet use a protocol of <span class="bold">HTTP</span> to send/receive messages. Your computer sends a <span class="bold">HTTP</span> request to a <span class="italic"> web server</span> then the <span class="italic">server</span> returns the document coded in <span class="bold">HTML</span> which your <span class="italic">web browser</span> then displays to your screen. <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-%20%203508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> This video</a> does a good job of explaining.

         Hypertext Markup Language is the most common coding used on the web. It has two parts to it, <span class="italic">TEXT</span> which is actually the written words you see and <span class="bold">MARKUP</span> which gives style to the text. There can be references to images or other pages.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         There are <span class="bold">tags</span> which most require an opening tag and a closing tag with content between them, such as <span class ="bold"> Bold</span> or <span class="italic">Emphasis</span>. As you can tell the tags can define how the content looks. The tags along with the content are called an <span class="italic">element</span>. There are several different tags such as <b>Anchor</b> which references a hyper-link. The <span class="bold">Image</span> tag will allow you to define a URL however it doesn't need a closing tag. The <span class="bold">Break</span> tag will allow you to add white space to the screen.

          Computers are stupid because they interpret 
          code literally. This means small mistake by a 
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         Three components comprise a webpage <span class="bold">HTML, CSS, & Javascript</span>which define appearance of the page. Since a webpage can be broke down into squares/rectangles view the same as a house. <span class="bold">HTML</span> is structure for instance walls or what roooms. <span class="bold">CSS</span> is the style or what color.<span class="bold">Java</span> is interact components, a change some element.

        The Tree Structure of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The <span class="italic">tags</span> of <span class="bold">HTML</span> will create a <span style="color:green">tree</span>  like structure. This is because there can be multiple <span class="bold">tags and elements</span> within another element. Look at this code, there is a <span class="bold">DIV</span> tag that has a <span class="bold">h2</span> tag and a <span class="bold">P</span> tag. The <span class="bold">P</span> tag has several <span class="bold">span</span> tags within it. These can be looked at like nested <span class="bold">boxes</span> within each other. This is referred as <span class="bold">DOM</span> <span class="italic">Document Object Model.</span> When you read an HTML document as 
          <span class="italic">text</span>, you see a wave of 
          changing indentations going up and down the left side 
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors Tools
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code programmers use special text editors 
          such as <span class="bold">Sublime</span> or <span class="bold">CodePen</span>. These editors make the 
          coding easier and some 
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you 
          write an opening tag.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets is what <span class="bold">CSS</span> stands for and allows control over style and structure of HTML code. It allows programmer to define style and then refer to it from the HTML code.

        CSS avoids Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Programmers</span> try to avoid repetition which waste time and allows for possibility of more errors. CSS will aid in this by allowing <span  class="italic">style</span> and <span  class="italic">structure</span> to be defined once and then referencing it multiple times from the code. This will aid in consistency of the document and allow one change to update every reference to the class.
